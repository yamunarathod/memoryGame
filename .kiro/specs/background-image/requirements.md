# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a consistent background image (s1.png) across all screens in the Ads Memory application. The background should be applied uniformly to provide visual consistency and enhance the user experience throughout the application.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a consistent visual background across all screens, so that the application feels cohesive and professionally designed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any screen loads THEN the system SHALL display the s1.png image as the background
2. WHEN the user navigates between screens THEN the system SHALL maintain the same background image
3. WHEN the background image is displayed THEN the system SHALL ensure it covers the full screen area
4. WHEN the background image is applied THEN the system SHALL maintain readability of all text and UI elements

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want the background image to be responsive, so that it displays properly on different screen sizes and devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the screen size changes THEN the system SHALL scale the background image appropriately
2. WHEN viewed on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain proper background coverage
3. WHEN viewed on desktop devices THEN the system SHALL maintain proper background coverage
4. WHEN the background scales THEN the system SHALL preserve the image aspect ratio

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the background implementation to be maintainable, so that future changes can be made efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the background THEN the system SHALL use a centralized approach to avoid code duplication
2. WHEN the background needs to be changed THEN the system SHALL require modification in only one location
3. WHEN new screens are added THEN the system SHALL automatically apply the background without additional configuration
4. WHEN the background is applied THEN the system SHALL not negatively impact application performance
