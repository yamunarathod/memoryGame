# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current MatchingScreen component only supports mouse-based drag and drop interactions, which limits usability on touch devices like smartphones and tablets. This feature will add comprehensive touch support to enable users to perform drag and drop operations using touch gestures, ensuring the matching game works seamlessly across all device types.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to drag and drop items using touch gestures, so that I can complete the matching game on my smartphone or tablet.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user touches and holds an answer item THEN the system SHALL initiate a drag operation
2. WHEN a user moves their finger while dragging THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback showing the item following the touch position
3. WHEN a user releases their finger over a valid drop zone THEN the system SHALL complete the drop operation
4. WHEN a user releases their finger outside a valid drop zone THEN the system SHALL return the item to its original position

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user on any device, I want consistent visual feedback during drag operations, so that I understand what actions are available and what's happening.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a drag operation begins THEN the system SHALL highlight the dragged item with visual styling
2. WHEN a dragged item is over a valid drop zone THEN the system SHALL highlight the drop zone
3. WHEN a dragged item is over an invalid drop zone THEN the system SHALL provide visual indication that dropping is not allowed
4. WHEN a drag operation is in progress THEN the system SHALL show a preview of the dragged item following the cursor/touch position

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the touch drag and drop to work alongside existing mouse functionality, so that the game works regardless of my input method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using a mouse THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing drag and drop functionality
2. WHEN using touch THEN the system SHALL provide equivalent drag and drop functionality
3. WHEN switching between input methods THEN the system SHALL handle both seamlessly without conflicts
4. IF a user has both mouse and touch capabilities THEN the system SHALL support both input methods simultaneously

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want touch interactions to feel natural and responsive, so that the game provides a smooth user experience.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN initiating a touch drag THEN the system SHALL respond within 100ms
2. WHEN dragging with touch THEN the system SHALL update the visual position smoothly at 60fps
3. WHEN completing a touch drop THEN the system SHALL provide immediate feedback about success or failure
4. WHEN touch dragging THEN the system SHALL prevent default browser behaviors like scrolling or text selection

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user with accessibility needs, I want the touch drag and drop to be accessible, so that I can use assistive technologies to complete the matching game.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using screen readers THEN the system SHALL announce drag and drop operations
2. WHEN drag operations occur THEN the system SHALL maintain proper ARIA labels and roles
3. WHEN items are matched THEN the system SHALL announce the successful match to screen readers
4. IF drag and drop is not available THEN the system SHALL provide alternative interaction methods
